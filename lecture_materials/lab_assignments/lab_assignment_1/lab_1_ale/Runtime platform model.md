Runtime Platform Models for MoonBoard Application Deployment

Processing Nodes
----------------
These are the servers and computing resources required for the application's operation, characterized by processing power, memory, storage, and network capabilities.

- Server Types for MoonBoard:
  - Application Servers: Host web services and APIs for user interactions, climb tracking, and data analytics.
  - Database Servers: Store user data, climb problems, and analytics, optimized for speed and reliability.
  - File Servers: Serve static content like images, videos, and climb problem definitions.

Client Nodes
------------
Devices through which users interact with the MoonBoard application. Specifications for these devices include screen resolution, processing power, and memory to ensure good user experience.

- Types and Requirements: Smartphones, tablets, kiosks, and their minimum hardware specifications.

Runtime Containers
------------------
Software environments hosting application components on both client and server nodes.

- Server-side Containers: May include Java EE containers (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss) for backend services.
- Client-side Environments: Web browsers or mobile device runtime environments like Android's Dalvik or ART.

Online and Offline Storage Hardware
-----------------------------------
Distinction between storage solutions for active data access and backup/archive systems.

- Online Storage: High-performance SSD arrays or cloud storage solutions for quick data retrieval.
- Offline Storage: Solutions for backups and archival, such as tape drives or HDDs, focusing on security and retrievability.

Network Links
-------------
Infrastructure connecting various nodes, with considerations for bandwidth, latency, and security for data transmission.

- Internal Network: High-speed connections within data centers for quick data exchange and processing.
- External Network: Internet connections and between deployment locations with security measures like encryption and VPN tunnels.

Other Hardware Components
-------------------------
Specialized hardware beyond servers and storage, including network security devices and user authentication systems.

- Network Security Devices: Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems.
- User Authentication Systems: Hardware tokens or biometric scanners.

Runtime Element-to-Node Mapping
-------------------------------
Allocating the application's software components to the identified hardware resources to ensure compatibility and performance.

- Mapping of backend services, databases, and static content to appropriate servers with required resources.

This document outlines the detailed components necessary for a robust and scalable deployment environment for the MoonBoard application.
