Context view

- show the drawing
- main elements: tycoons, customer service, tycoon financial analysts, bank, trip owner,
scanners (turnstiles, controllers), terminals (physical, web app, phone app), banks, physical infrastructure

- main decisions:
    - insert financial analysts to stress a need tycoon might have
    - abstract turnstiles as anything that scans tickets / cards (might be controller), as they need interaction with the same functional elements (user state)
    - abstract terminals as any means of buying tickets, handle subs/accounts (can be app, website, terminal, ticket office)
