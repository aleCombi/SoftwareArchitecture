DEPLOYMENT VIEW 

CONCERNS
1. Runtime Platform Required 
    - board hardware, phones, servers, databases
    - network requirements-> firewall
    - clouds?
    - mapping to the functional element (images loader, board interface, problems retriever, UI, 
    gyms API, statistics calculator, shop, contacts management)
    - software specs
2. Specification and Quantity of Hardware 
or Hosting Required
    - quantity of hardware
    - SLAs
    - hardware specs
3. Third-Party Software Requirements
    - operating  systems,  programming  libraries,  messaging  systems,  application
servers, databases, data movement products, Web servers
4. Technology Compatibility
    - For example, a database interface library
may require a particular OS network library in order to function
correctly,  or  a  disk  array  may  require  a  particular  type  of  interface  in  the
machines that will access it.
5. Network Requirements
    - consequence of the mapping with functional view   
6. Network Capacity Required
7. Physical Constraints
8. Stakeholder Concerns

MODELS
1. Runtime Platform Models (hardware nodes + network connections)
    - Processing nodes (server) -> User auth, climbing problem storage and retrieval, file servers for static data, 
    - Client nodes (phones, laptops of users)
    - Runtime containers (software application server or a client virtual machine)
    - Online storage hardware (capacity and speed)
    - Offline storage hardware (maybe backup), (type, capacity, speed, and location)
    - Network links (links between your hardware nodes)
    - Runtime element-to-node mapping (mapping to functional view)
