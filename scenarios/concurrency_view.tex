    Artifact & Hybrid approach of delayed processing and local caching implemented in the TrIP system. \\
    Response & The turnstile, equipped with local caching, validates the passenger's ticket against stored data, allowing entry. Transaction details are queued for delayed processing once network connectivity resumes, ensuring no service disruption. \\
    Measure & Passenger service continuity is maintained with 99.9\% uptime, and ticket validations during outages show no significant delay, ensuring high system availability. \\
