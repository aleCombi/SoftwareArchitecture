    Source & Tycoon's analytical system requesting data for route pricing and passenger account details. \\
    Stimulus & The Tycoon system sends a data request to analyze route prices based on their subscription models and to gather specific account information for passengers. \\
    Artifact & Tycoon API interfacing between the Tycoon's systems and the TrIP system's databases. \\
    Response & The Tycoon API promptly routes the queries to the appropriate data providers, retrieves the requested information, and consolidates the results for the Tycoon system. \\
    Measure & Tycoon system receives comprehensive data within 3 seconds, enabling effective route and subscription analysis for passenger accounts. \\

    Artifact & Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern within the TrIP system. \\
    Response & Developers update the Pricing Model with the new algorithm, which automatically propagates changes to the relevant Views without requiring additional adjustments. \\
    Measure & The system update is deployed with zero downtime, and subsequent feature updates require 40\% less time due to decoupled architecture. \\

    Artifact & MVC pattern facilitating the User Account management. \\
    Response & The Controller processes the passenger's input, updates the User Account Model, and the View dynamically reflects the changes, providing immediate visual confirmation to the passenger. \\
    Measure & Passengers express a 90\% satisfaction rate with the ease of updating preferences, and the error rate in preference updates decreases by 50\%. \\
