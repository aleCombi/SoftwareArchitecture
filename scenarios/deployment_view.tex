    Source & TrIP system experiencing a surge in demand due to a new university opening at a station. \\
    Stimulus & Passenger numbers have more than quadrupled, causing performance delays during rush hours. \\
    Artifact & The deployment of the TrIP system across public cloud servers and private cloud servers. \\
    Response & The system's cloud infrastructure is updated to leverage elastic scaling capabilities. Load balancers distribute the increased traffic efficiently, and additional computing resources are allocated to handle the high load, particularly for route optimization and payment processing components. \\
    Measure & Post-update, the TrIP system handles a fourfold increase in user load with response times reduced by 70\%, ensuring that all passengers complete their transactions and receive route information within 2 seconds, even during peak rush hours. \\

    Stimulus & The need to verify and bolster the security measures in place to protect passenger data. \\
    Artifact & Deployment architecture of the TrIP system with a focus on data servers and encryption protocols. \\
    Response & The system utilizes advanced encryption for data at rest and in transit within private cloud servers. Access controls are strictly enforced, ensuring only authenticated and authorized components interact with sensitive data. Periodic security audits and real-time intrusion detection systems are in place to monitor and immediately respond to any unauthorized access attempts. \\
    Measure & Security tests confirm no data leakage, and the system's compliance with the latest privacy regulations is validated by a third-party security firm, ensuring that the board and tycoons have verifiable assurance of the system's security measures. \\
