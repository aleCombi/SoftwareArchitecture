\subsubsection{Description}
The Information View of the TrIP SYSTEM is about how data moves and is stored. The system uses several databases. The Timetable + Prices + Bookings DB keeps track of schedules, prices, and reservations. The Optimized Routes DB has data on the best travel paths. The Accounts/Subs DB holds information on user accounts and subscriptions. The Tickets DB records ticket purchases, and the Payments DB keeps a record of all payments.

Tycoons use the Tycoon API to put in and get data. Passengers use terminals, apps, or websites to book travel and select routes. This choice and payment info go into the databases, updating the system.

The Routes component uses the Optimized Routes DB to give passengers the best travel options. The Accounts (Subs) part handles subscription details and payments, working with the Accounts/Subs DB. For single tickets, there's a separate interface that works with the Tickets DB. Payments process transactions and send completed payment information to the bank.

    Tycoon & Tycoons responsible for making requests for analysis, and inserting travel data. \\
    Tycoon API & Tycoon's way of interacting to the TrIP system. \\
    Timetable + Prices + bookings DB & Stores data regarding travel schedules, pricing, and booking information. \\
    Optimized routes DB & Contains information on the most efficient travel routes that have been calculated and stored. \\
    Accounts/Subs DB & Maintains records of user accounts and their subscriptions for travel services. \\
    Tickets DB & A database that logs ticket purchases and holds ticket-related information. \\
    Payments DB & Records and processes transactions related to payments within the system. \\
    Passenger & The end-user or customer who utilizes the system for travel services. \\
    Bookings & The system component or interface that passengers interact with to manage and view their bookings. \\
    Terminal / App / Website & The various platforms through which passengers can access the system for services. \\
    Routes & Involves the determination and selection of travel routes within the system. \\
    Accounts (Subs) & Manages the subscription details associated with user accounts. \\

\subsection{View: Scanning information flows}
\subsubsection{Model}

    \caption{Information view related to the scanning procedure.}
    \label{fig:information_view_scanning}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Description}
The TrIP SYSTEM's scanning procedure is a sequence that starts with the Passenger, who scans at the Turnstile to gain entry. This triggers the Update/Authorize process, updating the Passenger State with the user's access rights. The Passenger State reflects the user's current permissions within the TRIP SYSTEM. Each userâ€™s information is recorded in the Passenger State DB, a database that tracks and manages user statuses.

\begin{table}[H]

    \caption{Legend for the Scanning Procedure in the Information View of the TrIP SYSTEM.}
    \label{tab:scanning_procedure_legend}
    \begin{tabular}{@{}llp{10cm}@{}}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Id} & \textbf{Name} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    1 & Passenger & The starting point representing the individual using the TrIP SYSTEM. \\
    2 & Turnstile & The physical or virtual entry point where the passenger scans to gain access. \\
    3 & Update / Authorize & The process that updates the system and authorizes the passenger to proceed. \\
    4 & Passenger State & The current status of the passenger within the system, which is updated after scanning. \\
    5 & Passenger State DB & The database that records the state information of the passenger. \\

\paragraph{Scenarios}
\input{scenarios/information_view.tex}

The Information View of the TrIP system provides a comprehensive architecture designed to handle and safeguard data movement and storage, ensuring the system's integrity and security.

The design segregates data across specialized databases, including those for Timetables + Prices + Bookings, Optimized Routes, Accounts/Subs, Tickets, and Payments. This segregation follows best practices in database security, preventing any single point of compromise and ensuring each database only holds data relevant to its function. Access to these databases is strictly regulated, with the system enforcing robust authentication and authorization mechanisms to verify and control interactions.

Encryption plays an important role in the system, particularly within the Accounts/Subs Database. It protects sensitive passenger information by using encrypted account lookup database. Data at rest within this database, as well as data in transit to and from it, is encrypted, thereby securing personal and travel information from unauthorized access.

Payments are a critical interaction point for the system and its users. The TrIP system approaches this by interfacing directly with banks for payment processing. This interface means that the sensitive financial information is managed within the secure domain of banking institutions, which are inherently designed to handle such data securely. This direct interfacing also implies that the TrIP system does not store payment details, which greatly reduces its liability and exposure to financial data breaches.

The Tycoon API serves as a broker for data access by tycoons. It provides a controlled access point, permitting only authorized tycoons to retrieve passenger data. This access control mechanism is crucial for maintaining passenger privacy and data security. It allows tycoons to access only the data necessary for their service offerings and nothing beyond that.

Using the scenarios provided, we can see how the system's design and technology choices map directly to its operations. Passengers entering their information into terminals or apps can be assured that their data will be encrypted and stored securely, as detailed in the first scenario. Payment processes, as per the second scenario, happen within the secure confines of the banking system. Lastly, the way the Tycoon API manages data requests ensures that passenger data is only accessed by authorized tycoons, enhancing privacy and data protection as outlined in the third scenario.
