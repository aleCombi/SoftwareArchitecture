\subsection{Description}
The functional view diagram of the TrIP system illustrates the major functions of the system and how they interact with each other. The diagram features boxes representing different functions, connected by arrows that represent interactions.
The system starts with the user, who can interact with the system through various interfaces, such as terminals, apps, or websites. The user can input their departure and arrival stations, and the system will then display a list of available routes. The user can then select a route and proceed to payment.
The payment system can handle various payment methods, including single tickets, subscriptions, and fillable cards. If the user has a subscription, the system will automatically check if the subscription is valid for the selected route. This is done by the Account and Subscription Management module, which communicates with the tycoon systems to verify the subscription. If the subscription is not valid, the user will be prompted to purchase a single ticket or top up their fillable card.
Once the payment is processed, the system will generate a ticket or update the user's travel card. The user can then scan their ticket or card at the turnstile to gain access to the train platform. The turnstile communicates with the Account and Subscription Management module to verify the ticket or card and update the passenger's state.
The system also includes a number of other functions, such as a booking system, a route optimization system, and a customer service system. The booking system allows users to reserve seats on trains. The route optimization system helps users find the most efficient routes between their departure and arrival stations. The customer service system provides support to passengers with inquiries and complaints.
The system is designed to be scalable and flexible, so that it can be easily adapted to accommodate new tycoons and changing business models. The system is also designed to be secure, so that passenger data is protected from unauthorized access.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Description}
The scanning procedure within the TRIP SYSTEM encapsulates the interactions between the passenger and the system's access control mechanisms. It begins with the user presenting a valid form of transit access—such as a card or mobile device—to a scanning device like a turnstile or bus scanner. This device then consults the User state, a repository of the passenger's authorization status, to allow or deny entry. In parallel, the Ticket Checker function verifies the user's credentials against the Accounts subsystem, which manages detailed account information and subscriptions. Any changes to the user's status are updated in real time in the central Database, ensuring accurate tracking of access and travel history. This process ensures a secure, streamlined experience for passengers while providing the system with the necessary oversight to prevent unauthorized access

\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\input{scenarios/functional_view.tex}

In addressing the Quality Attribute (QA) priorities highlighted by users, our functional viewpoint incorporates several key decisions designed to enhance usability, maintainability, scalability, and performance efficiency.

To meet the usability needs of users, we have opted for standardized User Interfaces (UIs). These UIs, being open-source and widely utilized, benefit from a large user base that contributes to their maintenance and robustness. This choice ensures a user-friendly and reliable interface for passengers over the long term. Furthermore, it aligns with the TRIP owner's preferences by offering ease of maintenance and low operational costs.

The introduction of multiple payment methods, including fillable cards, credit cards, and single tickets, significantly simplifies passenger interaction with the TRIP system. The integration of accounts and subscriptions further facilitates seamless travel across multiple tycoon networks, enabling passengers to efficiently manage and use their subscriptions.

In response to Event 1, which underscored the need for easier integration of new tycoons, we have implemented the Tycoon API. This API standardizes data requests from each tycoon, irrespective of their mode of transportation, thus facilitating the smooth integration of new tycoons into the system. The Tycoon API, in conjunction with the accounts and bookings module, ensures that passengers can effortlessly utilize their subscriptions across different networks and book their preferred routes.

Event 3, which focused on traffic jams, raised the importance of optimizing system performance during peak periods. By deciding on a centralized route management module, we have streamlined data flow between the TRIP system and the tycoons. This module not only simplifies data management but also enhances the system's ability to handle high request volumes through optimization and caching strategies.

In summary, the functional viewpoint of our system meticulously addresses the initial QA priorities, along with the challenges presented by new tycoon integration (Event 1) and traffic jams (Event 3). These decisions collectively ensure a user-friendly, scalable, and high-performing TRIP system for passengers, tycoons, and the TRIP owner alike.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Description}
The Information View of the TRIP SYSTEM is about how data moves and is stored. The system uses several databases. The Timetable + Prices + Bookings DB keeps track of schedules, prices, and reservations. The Optimized Routes DB has data on the best travel paths. The Accounts/Subs DB holds information on user accounts and subscriptions. The Tickets DB records ticket purchases, and the Payments DB keeps a record of all payments.

Tycoons use the Tycoon API to put in and get data. Passengers use terminals, apps, or websites to book travel and select routes. This choice and payment info go into the databases, updating the system.

The Routes component uses the Optimized Routes DB to give passengers the best travel options. The Accounts (Subs) part handles subscription details and payments, working with the Accounts/Subs DB. For single tickets, there's a separate interface that works with the Tickets DB. Payments process transactions and send completed payment information to the bank.

\subsection{Description}
The TRIP SYSTEM's scanning procedure is a sequence that starts with the Passenger, who scans at the Turnstile to gain entry. This triggers the Update/Authorize process, updating the Passenger State with the user's access rights. The Passenger State reflects the user's current permissions within the TRIP SYSTEM. Each user’s information is recorded in the Passenger State DB, a database that tracks and manages user statuses.
