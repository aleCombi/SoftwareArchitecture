\subsection{Description}
The functional view diagram of the TrIP system illustrates the major functions of the system and how they interact with each other. The diagram features boxes representing different functions, connected by arrows that represent interactions.
The system starts with the user, who can interact with the system through various interfaces, such as terminals, apps, or websites. The user can input their departure and arrival stations, and the system will then display a list of available routes. The user can then select a route and proceed to payment.
The payment system can handle various payment methods, including single tickets, subscriptions, and fillable cards. If the user has a subscription, the system will automatically check if the subscription is valid for the selected route. This is done by the Account and Subscription Management module, which communicates with the tycoon systems to verify the subscription. If the subscription is not valid, the user will be prompted to purchase a single ticket or top up their fillable card.
Once the payment is processed, the system will generate a ticket or update the user's travel card. The user can then scan their ticket or card at the turnstile to gain access to the train platform. The turnstile communicates with the Account and Subscription Management module to verify the ticket or card and update the passenger's state.
The system also includes a number of other functions, such as a booking system, a route optimization system, and a customer service system. The booking system allows users to reserve seats on trains. The route optimization system helps users find the most efficient routes between their departure and arrival stations. The customer service system provides support to passengers with inquiries and complaints.
The system is designed to be scalable and flexible, so that it can be easily adapted to accommodate new tycoons and changing business models. The system is also designed to be secure, so that passenger data is protected from unauthorized access.

\subsection{Analysis on Perspectives}
In addressing the Quality Attribute (QA) priorities highlighted by users, our functional viewpoint incorporates several key decisions designed to enhance usability, maintainability, scalability, and performance efficiency.

Enhancing Usability
To meet the usability needs of users, we have opted for standardized User Interfaces (UIs). These UIs, being open-source and widely utilized, benefit from a large user base that contributes to their maintenance and robustness. This choice ensures a user-friendly and reliable interface for passengers over the long term. Furthermore, it aligns with the TRIP owner's preferences by offering ease of maintenance and low operational costs.

Flexible Payment Options
The introduction of multiple payment methods, including fillable cards, credit cards, and single tickets, significantly simplifies passenger interaction with the TRIP system. The integration of accounts and subscriptions further facilitates seamless travel across multiple tycoon networks, enabling passengers to efficiently manage and use their subscriptions.

Scalability and Integration with Tycoon API
In response to Event 1, which underscored the need for easier integration of new tycoons, we have implemented the Tycoon API. This API standardizes data requests from each tycoon, irrespective of their mode of transportation, thus facilitating the smooth integration of new tycoons into the system. The Tycoon API, in conjunction with the accounts and bookings module, ensures that passengers can effortlessly utilize their subscriptions across different networks and book their preferred routes.

Addressing Performance During Peak Periods
Event 3, which focused on traffic jams, raised the importance of optimizing system performance during peak periods. By deciding on a centralized route management module, we have streamlined data flow between the TRIP system and the tycoons. This module not only simplifies data management but also enhances the system's ability to handle high request volumes through optimization and caching strategies.

In summary, the functional viewpoint of our system meticulously addresses the initial QA priorities, along with the challenges presented by new tycoon integration (Event 1) and traffic jams (Event 3). These decisions collectively ensure a user-friendly, scalable, and high-performing TRIP system for passengers, tycoons, and the TRIP owner alike.
