\section{Development Viewpoint}
We start discussing the information viewpoint by analyzing stakeholder concerns that need to be addressed.
We individuated the following user stories:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \item \userStoryFour % As a tech-savvy passenger, I want to use a mobile app for managing my subscriptions, making payments, and receiving digital tickets for a paperless and convenient travel experience.
    \item \userStorySeven % As an advocate for accessibility, I want the system to offer voice-activated features and screen reader compatibility.
    \item \userStoryFourteen % As a visually impaired person, I want a high contrast interface and big font to avoid mistakes when buying tickets.
    \item \userStoryNine % As a tourist, I want to choose among many languages so I don't have to translate using my phone.
  \end{itemize}
  
As a consequence, we decided to prioritize Quality Attributes for this view as indicated in Table~\ref{tab:development_view}.

\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Description}
The diagram portrays the broker architecture in the TrIP system, delineating the communication between clients, the broker, and providers. Tycoon clients initiate the interaction by registering with the Tycoon API broker. Queries are sent from the Tycoon to the broker, which then forwards these queries to the relevant providers. These providers include services for Accounts, Payments, Bookings, Tickets, and Routes, each playing a pivotal role in processing Tycoon requests. Upon gathering the necessary data or performing the required actions, providers send their response back to the broker. The broker, in turn, forwards this information back to the Tycoon client, completing the request-response cycle. This broker pattern facilitates a structured approach to handling requests and centralizes the communication logic, simplifying interactions across the systemâ€™s diverse components.

\subsubsection{Analysis on Perspectives}
\textbf{Scenarios}
\scenarioOneDevelopment

\noindent \textbf{Broker Architecture:} \\
In parallel, the broker architecture employed within the Tycoon API streamlines the interaction process between the Tycoons and the TrIP system. It serves as a centralized point for processing queries and handling communications, thus simplifying the complexity of these interactions. For the Tycoons, this architecture means usability is significantly enhanced, allowing them to communicate through a unified interface with the Tycoon API, which abstracts the intricate workings of the TrIP system's service modules. This consolidation of communication logic not only benefits the Tycoons but also reduces the overhead for the TrIP system in managing multiple communication protocols. \\

\subsection{View: Model-View-Controller pattern for User Interface}

    \label{fig:development_view_User_Interface}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Description}
This diagram illustrates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern applied within the TrIP system. It breaks down the system's user interface into Views, which are responsible for presenting data to users and include interfaces for Payment, User Account, Route, and Pricing. The Models act as the data layer with Payment, Route, User Account, and Pricing components that manage the system's state. They receive state queries and broadcast state changes to the Views. Controllers interpret user gestures, direct state changes, and mediate between the Models and Views. This separation of concerns ensures that user interactions are handled efficiently, system data is managed cohesively, and business logic is executed in a controlled manner. The MVC architecture is fundamental to the system's organization, promoting clear delineations between different functionalities and facilitating ease of maintenance and scalability.

\noindent The Development Viewpoint focuses on the structural aspects that underpin the TrIP system's architecture, highlighting the modular approach in system design to enhance usability and maintainability. \\

\noindent \textbf{MVC Pattern:} \\
The adoption of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern substantially improves the system's maintainability by segregating the user interface elements (Views) from the business logic (Models) and user input processing (Controllers). This separation of concerns allows developers to update or modify one aspect of the system â€” such as adding new features to the user interface â€” without the need to alter the underlying business logic or control flow. For passengers, this results in a more comprehensive interface with a variety of options and features, enhancing the overall usability of the system. The MVC pattern ensures that as passenger needs evolve, new Views can be added swiftly, making the system both adaptable and future-proof. \\

These architectural decisions, reflected in the Development Viewpoint, are key to the TrIP system's ability to offer an efficient, secure, and user-friendly platform that can grow and adapt in line with technological advancements and user expectations.
