\section*{Product Introduction}
The Train Inter Payment System (TrIP) is a collaborative project initiated by three railroad tycoons to streamline the payment process for train travel. These tycoons, operating a network connecting towns, industries, and a university, aim to address the interoperability issues of their existing payment systems. TrIP will feature smart payment terminals at each station, enabling direct communication for subscription validation or single-fare payments. This system, underpinned by a service-based architecture, involves critical components like payment terminals and tycoon-specific systems. It's designed with key stakeholder requirements in mind: maintainability and operational efficiency for the owner, usability and reliability for the tycoons, and usability and security for passengers. The project seeks to ensure passengers can easily manage payments and subscriptions across the network, enhancing the overall travel experience while safeguarding user data.
