\section*{Decision 2: Subscription Model Structure}

\subsection*{Status}
Open

\subsection*{Architectural Summary}
In developing the TrIP system, we explore subscription model architectures that align railway tycoons' need for flexibility with passengers' demand for simplicity. We assess the trade-offs between unified and tycoon-specific models to enhance both operational autonomy and passenger convenience.

\subsection*{Concern}
The challenge is creating a subscription model that supports diverse railway operator requirements while ensuring ease of use for passengers.

\subsection*{Context}
This decision focuses on structuring and managing subscription tiers and fees within the TrIP system, ensuring compatibility across the network.

\subsection*{Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
\item Flexibility in options and pricing.
\item Passenger usability.
\item Operational simplicity for tycoons.
\item Revenue optimization.
\item System integration complexity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Option 1: Unified Subscription Model}
A single model across all operators, simplifying passenger experience but requiring significant coordination on benefits, pricing, and revenue sharing.

\subsection*{Option 2: Tycoon-Specific Subscription Models}
Individual models for each operator, allowing customization but potentially complicating user experience with multiple subscriptions.

\subsection*{Option 3: Hybrid Subscription Model}
A combination of a unified base subscription with optional tycoon-specific add-ons. This model aims to simplify basic travel while allowing customization for enhanced benefits, facilitated by a standardized API for ease of integration and operational flexibility.

\subsection*{Decision}
We opt for the Hybrid Subscription Model, balancing simplicity for passengers with flexibility for tycoons. This model utilizes a standardized API, ensuring interoperability and reducing complexity.

\subsection*{Consequences}
\textbf{Positive Consequences:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simplifies basic travel subscriptions for passengers.
\item Allows tycoons to offer customizable add-ons.
\item Reduces integration complexity through a standardized API.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Negative Consequences:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Challenges in consensus on the base tier.
\item Complexity in managing a dual-structured subscription model.
\item Learning curve for passengers and operators adjusting to the hybrid model.
\end{itemize}
This approach seeks to balance stakeholder interests, with room for iterative refinement as the system evolves.
