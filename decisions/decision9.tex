\subsection*{Context}
\subsubsection*{QA Scenario} % not always needed I believe
\subsection*{Criteria}
% \begin{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

Get online account, how to open account (at terminal, online, app), how to make the turnstile/controller know that you have the account (anonymous card, bank card, nominal card, nfc).

\subsection*{Option 1: anonymous card}
\subsection*{Option 2: bank credit card}
Pay at the terminal
\subsection*{Option 3: phone app}
You can payonline and create accounts, you can scan qr code from the app or nfc (google wallet) at turnstiles.

\subsection*{Option 4: nominal card}
Pay at terminal, get account and card, scan it at turnstiles. Access online account via browser. (possibly mix with opt 3)

\subsection*{Option 5: NFC reader/google wallet}


\subsubsection*{User Stories}
\subsection*{Decision}
app (with nfc, connected to bank account) + fillable card (for tourists, anoymous) + physical nominal card.
Deciding to have everything can require a lot of work: is it justified?

We want to scan either credit cards or QR code at scanning devices:
    - bank plugin that gives an ID of the card (connected to account or not) 
    - qr code on a ticket / TRIP card / app generated / fillable card
% TODO: discussion about pros/cons and user stories, depending on given prios of stakeholders and previous decision.
