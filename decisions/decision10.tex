\subsection{Decision 10: Data update from tycoons or station management}

\subsection*{Status}
Open.
\subsection*{Architectural Summary}


\subsection*{Concern}
Scalability is a concern, a data update can also be the addition of a tycoon.
\subsubsection*{User stories}

\subsection*{Context}
Databases and APIs are concerned.
\subsubsection*{QA Scenario} % not always needed I believe
Consider the scenario of adding/removing a tycoon, adding/removing routes and stations.
\subsection*{Criteria}
% \begin{itemize}
% \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Option 1: We impose the tycoons an API and ask them to give updates, which we store in a database}
Pro: you can precompute optimized routes.
Pro: if database is updated often enough by tycoons, info is almost realtime
Con: database needs to be managed

\subsection*{Option 2: We ask information on the fly and impose a queryable format or implement an API for each of them}
Pro: almost real-time update
Con: can't precompute

\subsection*{Decision}[\textit{Sketch}]
We want db:
- performance (=> usability)
- availability 
- integrability
