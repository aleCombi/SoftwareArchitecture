DECISION ON SCANNING
- user state module
- what do we scan?
    - on method correspond to one authorization processes
    - QR can work for tickets/physical cards/app
    - bank card need bank plugin
    - NFC auth is fancy but might add complications (maybe same tech as tapping card?)

- Decision:
    - QR for ticket/app/fillable/nominal + bank cards + NFC if it doesnt add too much complication (TODO)

- Consequences:
    - we consider an ID linked to account or signle ticket or fillable card -> just one module for account management
    - data storage for those account or signle ticket or fillable card are different:
        - single ticket are temporary (create/destroy records quickly) -> exploit that we know when a ticket expires
        - fillable cards are anoymous 
        - balance on accounts

DECISION ON PAYMENT
- fillable card/ account with balance -> balance manager separated from actual payment
- interaction with bank:
    - refill
    - bank card when you exit the turnstile (if credit you can take some money as collateral) -> needs external authentication, more communication with the bank
    - single pay at terminal


STATE MANAGEMENT
- turnstiles need to allow exit or not
