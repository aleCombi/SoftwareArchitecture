HOMEWORK

1) Viewpoints to png to tex (CA) (DONE)
2) Create viewpoint descriptions (CA) (DONE)
3) Make stakeholders view nicer (CA) (DONE)
4) Clean decisions (AC): 
    - decision 1-5 are complete. (DONE)
    - decision 6 (db scope) still needs to be done (I added an option), but everything except the actual decision (and consequences) is ready
    - decision 7 (customer service) can be reviewed in the text and some info can be added, but it is fundamentally ready.
    - decision 8 (turnstiles) need to be done, options are there.
    - decision 9 and 10 (Account management and authentication / db update) are only sketched.
    - decisions 11 and 12 might be merged. All info is there, but a decision has to be made.
    - decision 13 (server/serverless) can be reserved for later, but info about the options is there and the format is decent.
5) check if decisions match functional viewpoint (e.g. turnstiles) (AC) (DONE)
6) Clarify Info, Concurrency, Deployment view
8) Decision 9 + context view granularity + info view legend (CA)
9) Decision 10 + consequences in the info/functional view + update functional view legend(AC)
10) User => passenger
11) Do we need a QA scenario for each decision?
12) Databases can be combined and access can be restricted if they are sharing some data (consistency)
13) separate dbs from functional view
14) how are revenues divided? 
    - option1: tap cards onboard trains, so that revenue can be given to the tycoon operating each train 
    - option2: get each tycoon a share of revenue based on the value of their subs+tickets (last year) => what about new ones
    - option3: they negotiate shares
15) Optimization messes with single tycoon business... how do you decide that?
